# Privacy Policy

As per *How does it work?* section in the main readme, this extension reads some data
that you enter directly (e.g. workout count) as well as data from your Garmin Connect
profile page.

The only network calls this extension makes are to the relevant Garmin Connect backend
services in order to download workouts; other than that all data you enter or receive
never leaves your device.

If you download the extension via your browser's official extension store, your browser
may collect basic information about you such as geographic region, age bracket, gender
etc, and use it for analytics purposes (e.g. the Chrome Web Store seems to be pretty tightly
integrated with Google Analytics). Some of this information may be shared with the
maintainers of Garmin Workout Downloader which we may use for various purposes such as
informing development decisions. We expect all data we receive at this stage to be
aggregated and anonymized.

If you choose to submit a GitHub issue on this project or contribute via a Pull Request,
GitHub will collect and publish some information such as your username. Refer to GitHub's
Privacy Policy for more information.
